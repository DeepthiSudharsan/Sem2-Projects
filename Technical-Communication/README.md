### EXCERPTS FROM THE PROJECT

In Reinforcement learning, we teach the computer how to group/classify/predict something by providing a reward when it guesses something correctly. 
It is similar to teaching your pet-dog to shake hands or stay-still. If the dog does what is expected, we provide him a reward. 
The dog soon learns what is expected and starts behaving the same way. A very good example of reinforcement is in game-bots. 
Some games have large state-space (possible positions) though the game rules might be simple. 
If we let the computer take an action and rebuke/reward it (using a reward function), it will soon learn what is the right move.

### Applications of Reinforcement Learning 

There are a variety of applications for Reinforcement learning in the physical world. A few examples would be finance, robotics, gaming, and NLP.

### Future Scope of Reinforcement Learning 

Though RL is in its infancy and has a lot of potential, there are a few challenges. To name a few: 
1) Primary among the challenges, is the number of attempts a computer might need to learn effectively. Typically, a complicated task like playing a game needs to be done millions of times to be effective. 
2) Many real-world problems where the risks of wrong results are high - like in Healthcare, Finance - ability to RL is limited. 
3) The ability to provide a suitable reward function is sometimes very hard and takes trial and error. 
4) There are numerous future applications that use reinforcement learning like smart traffic signals, advanced self-driving cars, autonomous robots, prosthetic limbs, automated factories etc. 
5) Using a reinforcement learning approach, generating molecules which exhibit inhibitory against various diseases has been made much easier. Drug designing can now have user designed properties due to this kind of an approach. Though there is room for improvement to overcome these challenges, reinforcement learning (RL) technology is surely going to do great things in the near future.
